    <h1>Hello There!</h1>
    <h2> Welcome to my website</h2>
    <p>My name is Ilolo Izu (e-lo-lo e-zu), known some places by my first nameâ€”Justin! I graduated with a Bachelor's degree focused in Allied Health with a Minor in Business Administration from Texas A&M University in December 2019. I am currently transitioning from the 4 years of experience in the Medical Field and seeking different professional opportunities. I'm currently learning Software Engineering from Flatiron School.
        I also have an interest in real estate investing and entrepreneurship. On the side, I also am a freelance <a href="https://www.iloloizu.com/"> videographer, photographer, and digital editor.</a> I also coach younger athletes in the sport of track and field to give back to the community all the knowledge I've learned as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilolo_Izu">decorated athlete</a> myself.</p>
